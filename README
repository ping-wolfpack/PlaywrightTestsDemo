The first project will test some REST API. To showcase your development skills, you can consider using config, wrappers, API clients, DTO but balance between simplicity and scalability.
Use the free REST API - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
The API call can be for any of the resources, /posts, /comments, /albums, /photos, /todos or /users. 
Have at least 1 test of each HTTP method.  GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.  
Have validations for the responses
Have at least 1 negative test
